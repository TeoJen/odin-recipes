		<h2>Description</h2>
		
			<p>This Classic Italian Tiramisu is seriously one of the easiest recipes and is made with a sweet mascarpone filling and layered with espresso dipped lady fingers. It's truly perfection and I can't believe I haven't made it since culinary school. Instead of resorting to my usual cookie consumption for dessert for all of our recent parties, I changed it up and made Tiramisu. BRILLIANT. It takes almost no time to make and the recipe below is one that my culinary school instructor literally engrained into our brains during the dessert portion of our curriculum.</p>
		
			<p>If you are making tiramisu as dessert for a dinner party, here's some dishes you can make to go with that: Cacio e Pepe, Bolognese, Pasta alla Vodka, Baked Rigatoni, Sausage with Tortellini</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			
		<ul class="ingredients">
			<li><strong>Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Espresso</strong> - you'll need a cup, so brew a handful of shots or buy them pre-brewed from your favorite coffee shop or grocery store</li>
			<li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Pasteurized Eggs</strong> - I always buy pasteurized eggs for this recipe as that means the eggs have been heat treated to kill off bacteria that could potentially cause a food borne illness. And since we're using raw eggs, it's the way to go!</li>
			<li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Kosher Salt</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Mascarpone Cheese</strong> - an integral part!! There isn't a great substitution here.</li>
			<li><strong>Heavy cream</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Ladyfinger Cookies</strong>> - make sure you get the hard ones</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		
		<ol class="steps">
			<li>Whisk together the cocoa powder, espresso and vanilla in a bowl and set aside to really infuse the flavors together.</li>
			<li>In a mixer or using a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add in the salt, mascarpone cheese and continue to whip until smooth.</li>
			<li>Add the chilled cream and continue to whip, until light, creamy and smooth</li>
			<li>Make sure it can hold a soft peak.</li>
			<li>Top the first layer of cookies with Â½ of the whipped mascarpone mixture and use the back of a metal spoon to spread it into an even layer. Dust with cocoa powder.</li>
			<li>Repeat for another layer and then finish by dusting with cocoa powder on top.</li>
			<li>Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
			
		</ol>
		
		<h2>How to Store Tiramisu</h2>
		
		<p>ou can store tiramisu covered with plastic wrap for 3-4 days. The flavors of the tiramisu marry and develop as it keeps, especially once its been stored overnight.</p>
		
		<h2>How to Freeze Tiramisu</h2>
		
		<p>I do not recommending freezing tiramisu since. The no-bake and nature of other ingredients do not make it a great candidate for freezing.</p>

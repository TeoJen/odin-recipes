		<h2>Description</h2>
			
			<p>It’s hard to think of a simpler, fresher and more bursting-with-flavor dish than Grilled Tuna Steaks served with an umami-loaded sesame soy dipping sauce! I grill ahi tuna over high heat, creating a rare center and beautiful grill marks, just like you see in upscale restaurants. As home cooks, we may feel a little intimidated to serve fish rare, assuming that only restaurant chefs can master this technique, but it’s surprisingly easy and fast.</p>
		
			<p>The sesame soy dipping sauce with pleasantly spicy fresh ginger doubles as a marinade, saving you a few steps. All you need are a few simple ingredients and a couple of high-quality tuna steaks, ideally yellowfin tuna (often marketed as ahi tuna). However, this recipe works equally well with other types of tuna, such as: bluefin, bonito/skipjack, bigeye or albacore.</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul class="ingredients">
			<li><strong>Fresh Tuna Steaks</strong>: Yellowfin/ahi, bluefin, bigeye, skipjack or albacore work, although albacore is a little drier. Frozen tuna can be as high-quality as fresh if you can’t easily get fresh.</li>
			<li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>: Regular or low sodium soy sauce.</li>
			<li><strong>Unseasoned Rice Vinegar</strong>: Be sure to use unseasoned rice vinegar, not the seasoned version that contains added sugar and salt.</li>
			<li><strong>Honey</strong>: Your favorite variety.</li>
			<li><strong>Green Onion</strong>: Look for a smooth, firm, bright green onion.</li>
			<li><strong>Toasted Sesame Oil</strong>: While plain sesame oil has very little color or flavor, toasted sesame oil has a deep amber color and a nutty, toasty aroma and flavor.</li>
			<li><strong>Fresh Ginger</strong>: Look for a plump fresh ginger hand with smooth, shiny skin.</li>
			<li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Fresh garlic bulbs should be plump and firm with smooth, silvery skin.</li>
			<li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: Use whatever variety you have on hand – extra virgin olive oil isn’t essential here.</li>
			<li><strong>Kosher Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper</strong></li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Whisk together dipping sauce ingredients (soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic).</li>
		<li>Preheat grill to high. Rinse and dry tuna steaks then rub all sides with oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Grill tuna steaks until seared on the outside and rare in the middle, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to cutting board and thinly slice tuna across the grain.</li>
	</ol>

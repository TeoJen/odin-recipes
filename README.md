The goal of this project is to demonstrate basic html skills by creating an index page with links to 3 recipe pages.

Each recipe page will contain link back to the home (index) page, image of a dish, list of ingredients and step-by-step guide on how to cook the dish.

Current focus is on html alone. Styling with CSS will be added in later lessons of The Odin Project.
